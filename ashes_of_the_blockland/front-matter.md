# Front Matter

This is a lighthearted story set in a world of tidy blocks and sturdy hearts.

- Expect humor with warmth.
- Expect adventure without cruelty.
- Expect that mistakes can be mended, and that rebuilding is not defeatâ€”it is proof of love.

Dedicated to anyone who has ever knocked down their own carefully stacked tower and learned, laughing a little, how to build it back better.
