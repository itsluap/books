# Ashes of the Blocklands

Welcome to a heartfelt, block-built adventure about community, courage, and the art of laughing when your roof is on fire (figuratively… mostly).

Follow MJSarcastic—adventurer, tinkerer, and unflappable smart-aleck—as she discovers that curiosity can wake dragons, but kindness and teamwork can build homes stronger than stone.

Turn the page when you're ready. The bell might ring. Bring a snack.
