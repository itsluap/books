# Chapter 5 — Ashes and Accountability

The camp rose at the west field where the wheat had not yet decided to be bread.

Tents bloomed like cautious flowers.

Cookfires stitched warmth into the wind.

People moved in the calm choreography of aftermath.

Children were counted and re-counted and hugged into squawks.

The injured were seen, soot wiped from foreheads with hands that shook only after the work was done.

MJ stood at the edge, looking back at smoke fingering the sky.

Her clothes smelled like courage and mistakes.

Piri pressed a mug into her hands.

“Drink,” she said.

MJ did.

It tasted like cinnamon and forgiveness brewing.

A meeting gathered under a canvas stretched between two carts.

Old Mina presided, because when the world lists, one looks for a steady keel.

Faces were tired, eyes rimmed with ash and emotions that had not found their words yet.

“The village lives,” Old Mina began.

“We grieve what we have lost, and we count—truly count—what we have kept.”

Nelli read off names and needs.

Blankets, bandages, bread.

Water, wood, watch rotations.

When the practicalities had made a solid floor, the roomful of air turned to MJ.

She did not shy.

She stepped forward because stepping back would trip someone.

“My curiosity woke it,” she said, voice steady on a bridge she was still building. “I thought I could outrun consequences. I could not. I am sorry.”

Silence came, but this time it carried thought instead of accusation.

Darrin cleared his throat.

“We’ve all benefited from your curiosity,” he said. “We also just ran for our lives from your curiosity.”

Piri crossed her arms.

“She brought bread warm as sunrise and also a dragon,” she said. “The first cancels some of the second, but not all.”

A few chuckles escaped despite themselves.

The sound let the tent breathe.

Nelli adjusted her spectacles, which was how she prepared the air for ideas.

“Accountability is not exile,” she said.

“It is responsibility with a task list.”

Heads nodded, some reluctantly, some with relief.

Old Mina’s gaze softened.

“We cannot rebuild until it is dealt with,” she said.

“We will not be prisoners to the sky.”

She turned to MJ.

“Will you lead the hunt?”

MJ swallowed a thousand feelings and chose one: yes.

“I will,” she said. “And I won’t be foolish alone.”

Good, said the tent with a sigh you could almost hear.

Plans unfolded like maps that had been waiting to be touched.

They spoke of traps and terrain, of bait that wasn’t cruelty, of signals and safe zones.

The golem would go, and so would the blacksmith, and Piri because someone had to make food taste like hope.

Nelli would coordinate from camp, her brain better at distances than her ankles.

Darrin contributed a net he swore could hold a whale, if whales could fly and were interested in nets.

“We can learn,” MJ said, laying out what she had seen.

“It likes high places and straight lines. It looks before it breathes. Its eyes are not cruel.”

“That last part is your optimism talking,” Piri said.

“It might be my experience,” MJ replied.

They tested the tin whistle tones.

They braided blue wool into signal flags.

They hammered stakes and softened edges on ideas that came out sharp.

At dusk, the village ate.

The stew tasted smoky in a way that was not entirely the recipe.

Someone told a joke about eggs that made the children groan and the elders pretend they were above it.

MJ sat at the fire with Old Mina.

“Why do you stay?” Old Mina asked, honest and kind.

MJ watched sparks climb and become stars.

“Because this is my wrong to right,” she said.

“And because leaving would make a hole a dragon could live in.”

Old Mina nodded like a bell that had learned to ring inside a head.

“Bring it down soft if you can,” she said.

“I have a feeling it remembers lullabies.”

“You saw the mosaic,” MJ said.

Old Mina’s eyebrow lifted.

“I’ve seen many things that people think are gone,” she said.

“The trick is remembering which parts were true.”

Night settled.

Watches were set.

The golem stood at the hill’s crest, eyes steady as two lanterns that did not waver.

MJ lay in her tent and replayed the fortress in her mind like a song she needed to learn by morning.

Sleep came clumsily.

Before dawn, she woke with a thought fully formed and a grin that frightened it a little.

“Teamwork,” she whispered.

“And a lullaby.”
