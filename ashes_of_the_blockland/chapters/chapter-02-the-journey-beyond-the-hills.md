# Chapter 2 — The Journey Beyond the Hills

Morning arrived with a polite knock on the window and a smell of cinnamon.

Piri had left a bundle of rolls at MJ’s door with a note that read, For bravery, or breakfast.

MJ packed as the village yawned awake.

She laid out tools in a neat row: compass, spyglass, flint, a pocket-sized anvil (don’t ask), and a spool of Old Mina’s blue wool.

Into the pack went bread, berries, bandages, and a map updated with a scribble that said Yes, we are doing this.

She donned leather boots rubbed with oil, a jacket patched with stories, and a grin.

At the edge of the square, Nelli handed her a book.

“Ruins and Riddles,” Nelli said. “Volume two. Volume one is mostly about the table of contents.”

“I love a table with contents,” MJ replied.

Darrin the trader pressed a tin whistle into her hand.

“For emergencies,” he said.

“Or concerts,” MJ said.

Old Mina wrapped the blue wool around MJ’s wrist.

“So you remember the color of home,” she murmured.

The golem offered a flower crown.

MJ put it on without a hint of irony.

“Watch the sky,” Piri warned. “It has opinions.”

With a last look at the bell tower, MJ stepped onto the road that curved toward the hills like a question mark growing braver.

The forest beyond the fields was a cathedral of leaves.

Sunlight fell through in coins.

Birds wrote gossip on the air.

MJ marked trees with a loop of blue wool, a breadcrumb trail for someone who preferred thread.

At noon, she climbed a hill that shrugged itself into a view.

The village lay below, framed by rivers and hope.

“Be good,” she whispered to it, which is what you say when you leave a cake unsupervised.

The land beyond rolled into biomes like pages in a generous book.

A desert offered its sands and secrets.

MJ tied her scarf over her nose and sang to keep time with her steps.

She saved the tin whistle for when the wind needed harmonizing.

At an oasis, she refilled her canteen and met a camel that considered her and decided she was probably okay.

They shared a stare that counted as a handshake.

By twilight, mesas rose like rust-red castles.

She camped in the lee of a rock with a personality and watched stars bloom in the sky’s dark garden.

She thought of the bell tower.

And of pies.

And of maps that did not end where hers did.

Morning found her in a pine forest that smelled like courage and sap.

She touched trunks as she passed, the way sailors pat a ship for luck.

A ravine yawned, polite but insistent.

MJ built a bridge of planks and stubbornness.

Halfway across, the wind told a joke and she laughed in spite of herself.

The bridge did not.

It held.

Mountains shouldered into the sky by afternoon, white-capped and slightly annoyed with gravity.

MJ followed a path that pretended not to be one.

Her breath made small clouds that drifted away to tell on her.

At a narrow pass, she found walls scratched with symbols.

Ruins and Riddles, Volume two, whispered possibilities.

She copied the markings into the margins.

Past the pass, the land opened into a valley the color of old coins.

At its heart stood an abandoned fortress.

It rose from the ground like a story someone had stopped telling, mid-sentence.

MJ approached with the care of a person who has learned that curiosity and caution can be friends.

The gate hung askew, squeaking in a key she recognized as Dramatic.

Inside, the courtyard held silence like a breath.

Vines reclaimed edges.

Moss softened pride.

She lit a lantern.

The light made the shadows step back just enough to be interesting.

Doorways led to rooms where dust laid out picnic blankets and waited for guests.

In the main hall, banners clung to rafters, faded but stubborn.

On the floor, a mosaic depicted a dragon cradling a village like a mother holds a child.

“That’s comforting,” MJ said to no one, which was a bold-faced lie.

She knelt to study the tiles.

The dragon’s eyes were pieces of green glass that seemed, unreasonably, to notice her.

She noticed them back.

At the hall’s end, stairs spiraled down into a throat of stone.

MJ ate a roll.

Then she descended.

The air cooled until it tasted like cave and memory.

Her lantern hummed.

In a chamber shaped like a held breath, she found an altar.

On it sat an egg.

It was the color of storm light and old jade.

It pulsed faintly, as if remembering a lullaby.

“Hello,” MJ said, because manners are better than fear.

The egg did not respond, which was both rude and reassuring.

Around the altar, the same symbols from the pass coiled in a protective knot.

MJ traced them.

Ruins and Riddles offered a translation that was suggestive rather than precise.

“Sleep,” she read.

“Guard.”

“Breathe slow.”

MJ set the lantern on a ledge and circled the room.

Her boot knocked a loose stone.

It clacked against a mechanism with the subtlety of a marching band.

Somewhere, something shifted.

The air took a sharp breath in.

The pulsing quickened.

MJ reached for the stone, for the egg, for the undo button reality had neglected to provide.

The chamber trembled.

Dust fell like gentle snow.

From deep within the fortress, a sound rose.

It started as a growl made of mountains.

It became a syllable the earth did not want to say.

MJ ran.

She ran as the hallways opened their mouths.

She ran as banners tried to wave advice.

She ran as the sound grew teeth and wings.

The fortress exhaled.

Something woke.

MJ did not look back.

She did not need to.

The sky did it for her.
