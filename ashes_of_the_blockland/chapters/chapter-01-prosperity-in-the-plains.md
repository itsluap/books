# Chapter 1 — Prosperity in the Plains

The plains were a quilt of greens and golds, stitched by rivers that ran like silver thread.

Cobblestone streets clicked cheerfully under cartwheels.

Fences stood in crisp lines, keeping sheep fluffy and opinions contained.

The marketplace woke early, as if dawn was a suggestion it happily overruled.

Bakers stacked loaves like bricks of sunlight.

Miners traded ore with hands still dusted in glittering gray.

Farmers arrived with baskets of vegetables that appeared to have been polished by pride.

Builders argued gently about angles, then hugged about arches.

Children chased each other between stalls, their laughter bouncing off stone and sky.

In the center of this harmony stood a bell tower, a polite giant in iron and oak.

When it rang, it meant dinner.

When it rang twice, it meant community meeting.

When it rang three times, it meant someone had seen a particularly funny chicken.

And on rare occasions, it meant run.

MJSarcastic—MJ to friends, MJSarcastic to people who enjoyed saying all the syllables—rolled into the square on a squeaky cart.

The cart was an invention.

The squeak was a feature.

“Behold,” she declared, hopping down with the dramatic flair of someone who has practiced landing poses, “auto-sorting crates. Left for edible. Right for regrettable.”

A tomato plopped into the left crate with a satisfied thump.

A mysterious jar labeled Experimental Jellyfish went right.

“Do we trade for jellyfish?” asked Darrin the trader, chewing a straw that had never known a toothbrush.

“Do we live in a world of surprise?” MJ countered.

“Touché,” said Darrin, who did not know what that meant but appreciated the sound.

MJ was the village’s tinkerer and sometimes explorer, a knitter of gadgets and a rewriter of gravity.

She wore a belt filled with tools, trinkets, and once, an entire sandwich she forgot about until it saved a life.

She had clever hands and a cleverer grin.

Her eyes liked horizons.

She fixed squeaks and made squeaks.

Both brought people to her door.

Near the fountain, Old Mina sold blue wool dyed with the rare skyflowers that grew along riverbanks.

“You gonna stay put long enough to taste the stew tonight?” Old Mina asked.

MJ glanced past the roofs to the hills beyond, where the land lifted its shoulders into secrets.

“Absolutely,” she said.

“Probably,” she corrected.

“We shall see,” she admitted, smiling.

“Take this,” Old Mina said, pressing a skein of blue into MJ’s hands. “For luck. Or for decorating the next contraption you swear won’t explode.”

“It won’t explode,” MJ promised.

Old Mina raised a single impressive eyebrow.

“On purpose,” MJ added.

Near the blacksmith, a golem stood patient as a mountain, its iron heart thudding in measured ticks.

Children decorated it with flowers and names like Sir Guardington the Third.

The golem did not seem to mind.

It had a job and a flower crown.

“MJ!” called Piri the baker, flour in her hair like a snowfall that refused to melt. “Taste-test?”

MJ accepted a warm roll and ate it with the focus of a philosopher consuming a profound idea.

“It tastes like if a sunrise decided to be bread,” she announced.

“Good,” Piri said, pleased. “Make sure your devices don’t eat the rest.”

“Only the burnt ones,” MJ said.

Piri laughed, the sound like a spoon tapping the rim of a mixing bowl.

Beyond the square, fields breathed in rows, wheat heads nodding like a thousand tiny, agreeable elders.

In the distance, the hills softened into a horizon so calm it invited wishes.

Prosperity was not a word the villagers used often, but it lived in their gestures.

It shone in polished windows.

It hummed in the steady knock of hammers and the soft cluck of contented hens.

At midday, a group gathered by the well—farmers with sun-browned arms, builders smelling faintly of cedar, and Nelli the librarian, whose spectacles magnified her curiosity to entertaining proportions.

“News?” Nelli asked, always hungry for stories like other people were hungry for berries.

“Harvest’s ahead of schedule,” said a farmer.

“Tunnel to the north found a pocket of lapis,” said a miner.

“I am thinking about making a clock that reads moods,” said MJ.

“Ah,” said the group, in the exact tone you use when you love someone and fear them a little.

“The needle would point at Hungry more than anything else,” Piri noted.

“Then it works,” MJ replied.

Laughter is a carpenter in a village like this.

It builds bridges no storm can wash away.

MJ’s workshop sat on the square’s edge, inviting in the way a porch light invites moths and neighbors.

Inside, shelves held jars with labels like Probably Fine and Not That Again.

Blueprints littered the table like shy paper birds.

In the corner sat a pack: rope, compass, water, a map.

The map was hand-drawn, smudged by use, and ended in an unfinished line that trailed off toward the hills.

MJ traced that line sometimes, the way you trace a thought you haven’t said out loud.

That afternoon, she fixed a well crank, mended a hinge, and invented a self-stirring stew spoon that worked perfectly except for insisting on clockwise.

“Counterclockwise is a lifestyle,” Piri declared, and the spoon sulked in the drawer until it came around.

As sunset soaked the village in orange and honey, the bell rang once for stew.

Neighbors gathered with bowls and stories.

MJ sat between Old Mina and Nelli, their conversation weaving over the table like ivy.

“Ever wonder what’s past those hills?” Nelli asked, pushing her glasses up as if the horizon might be revealed beneath them.

“Always,” MJ admitted.

“You could go,” Old Mina said, as if suggesting someone try the blueberry pie.

“I could,” MJ said.

She looked at the hills.

They looked back with the patient friendliness of old dogs.

For a long breath, MJ listened to the village sing its small, perfect song.

Chickens negotiated bedtime.

Lanterns blinked alive along the lanes.

The golem bowed to a child and took up its watch.

The bell’s rope, quiet now, swayed slightly like it, too, had a heartbeat.

Contentment sat with MJ like a cat, soft and purring.

And still, beyond contentment, curiosity scratched lightly at the door.

“Tomorrow,” MJ told it.

“Tomorrow, we look.”
