# Chapter 4 — Fire and Falling Walls

The first gout of flame struck the old granary and turned it briefly into a sunrise.

Heat rippled the square.

Banners bucked.

Windows winced.

“Buckets!” shouted the blacksmith, voice iron-hot.

A line formed from the well to the blaze, hands passing water, water passing courage.

Arrows lifted, a hesitant forest pointed at the sky.

“Only if it comes low!” Old Mina warned. “We are not offering it splinters for dinner.”

The dragon banked, wind kicking up bread crumbs and blue wool.

MJ sprinted along the shadow edge, trying to be the noisiest, brightest nuisance available.

“Over here!” she yelled. “Highly flammable personality! Little actual kindling!”

It worked, a little.

The dragon’s head snapped toward her and flame licked the cobblestones where she had been a heartbeat before.

The cobbles, to their credit, did not complain.

A golem thundered forward, iron feet punching meaning into the ground.

It lifted a shield the size of a door and took a blast that blackened its chest but did not dim its eyes.

Children cheered because even in disaster, heroes deserve applause.

The bell tolled, steady as a heartbeat refusing to quit.

MJ darted under an awning as arrows arced up, fell short, and clattered like apologies.

“Not yet!” she cried. “Save them for when it drinks the air!”

They waited, trembling with patience, a difficult art.

The dragon rose, circled, and dove.

MJ ran for the central well and vaulted its rim.

Cool stone kissed her palms.

She grabbed the crank and jammed it, turning the well cap into a shield just as fire washed across the square.

The world went white-orange and loud.

When color returned, it was ash and ember and blue wool fluttering like brave birds.

“MJ!” Piri shouted from behind an overturned cart. “Left!”

MJ leapt as a beam fell, the world briefly becoming a puzzle of splinters.

She rolled, came up smiling because sometimes the grin arrives before the fear can.

The dragon banked again, eye catching on movement near the livestock pens.

Cows huddled, wide-eyed and unconsulted.

MJ ran without thinking, which is to say she thought of them and nothing else.

She unlatched the gate and smacked a rump with an apology.

The herd bolted toward the creek, stubborn survival wrapped in wobbling grace.

Flame chased them and found the fence instead.

It sighed into cinders.

“Builders!” the blacksmith roared. “Form ranks! We keep the paths open!”

They did, with axes and grit and a surprising number of helpful curses.

The golem took another blast, knees buckling for a breath, then straightening with a sound like a promise.

“Arrows!” Old Mina commanded as the dragon sucked in air so deeply the clouds reconsidered their positions.

The first volley rose like a flock deciding to become punctuation.

Several found scales and bounced, annoyed but informative.

One wedged between plates.

The dragon flinched.

It was not invulnerable.

“More of that,” MJ panted, dodging a falling sign that used to say Eggs 2 for 1 but now advertised Unplanned Modern Art.

The bell’s rope snapped.

The bell kept ringing because the golem had placed a hand on it and refused to let silence win.

A farm roof gave way with a sound like an exhausted sigh.

Sparks leapt to the bakery and Piri shouted an oath that would have curdled cream.

MJ grabbed a tarp and a bucket and a prayer and joined the line, sloshing water where flame argued with wood.

“Counterclockwise!” she yelled at the self-stirring spoon as it tried to help in circles. “Fine. Do your thing.”

The spoon stirred smoke like it was making sky soup.

No one had the heart to tell it that wasn’t how physics worked.

For a heartbeat, MJ saw the village as a map of small, brave acts.

Hands lifting.

Feet running.

Eyes meeting and saying, We’re here.

The dragon roared again, lower, as if frustration had found its throat.

It dove for the bell tower, claws biting stone.

The tower shuddered, the bell jumping in its yoke.

“Down!” MJ screamed as chips of stone hailed the square.

The golem planted itself at the tower’s base, arms up, bracing.

The dragon’s weight drove cracks like lightning down the tower’s side.

MJ’s vision narrowed to a single terrible math problem: load, stress, consequence.

“Brace the west wall!” she shouted.

Builders moved as one, beams on shoulders, courage on sleeves.

Piri threw her apron over MJ’s head as a burning shutter flew past and fell where she had been standing.

“Hey!” MJ protested from under flour-scented darkness.

“Later,” Piri said. “Preferably with pie.”

The tower groaned, a sound like an elder rising.

“Get clear!” Old Mina called.

The bell tolled once, twice, then gave up its shape to gravity.

Stone fell.

Dust rose.

When the air thinned, the tower was lower by a story and the dragon fought to free a claw wedged in the broken masonry.

Arrows found soft places.

It snarled.

It lifted, wounded pride dripping sparks.

“Evacuation complete!” Nelli shouted from the west road, hair full of ash, eyes full of inventory. “All accounted for!”

MJ’s chest loosened around a breath she didn’t know she held.

“Then we fall back,” Old Mina ordered.

“Now.”

They retreated in a practiced shamble, not a rout—faces forward, steps measured, hands still passing water to the fires that would not take the rest.

MJ looked back once.

The square smoldered.

The well steamed.

The golem stood amid wreckage, silhouette brave against a sky gnawed by smoke.

The dragon wheeled above it, angry and unsure, a storm that had mistaken itself for fate.

“Next time,” MJ whispered to the air and to herself, “we make a plan that sings.”
