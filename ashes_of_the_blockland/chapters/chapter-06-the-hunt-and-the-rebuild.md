# Chapter 6 — The Hunt and the Rebuild

They set out at first light, a line of determination stitched across the hills.

MJ led with the tin whistle on a cord and the blue wool at her wrist.

The golem strode beside her, steps counting in iron.

Piri carried a pack that sloshed and smelled like comfort.

The blacksmith bore a harpoon that was mostly for morale.

Darrin had a net and optimism to match.

They moved through the pine forest where trees leaned in like elders eager for gossip.

At the ravine, the bridge still held because sometimes your past self is wiser than you remember.

They crossed into the valley shaped by old coins and old stories.

The fortress rose, patient and possible.

“Positions,” MJ said, and people became their best verbs.

Piri set up a cookfire because hunger is an enemy of bravery.

The blacksmith and Darrin rigged the net between two towers like a spider with ambitions.

The golem tested the anchor points with a nudge that would have moved a house.

Nelli’s flags bobbed in the breeze from their hill watch, blue wool blinking ready.

MJ descended into the hall, lantern in hand, heart on steady.

She traced the mosaic dragon with her finger.

“It’s a memory,” she said to herself. “Not a prophecy.”

In the chamber of the egg, the air remembered her.

The altar sat, stubborn and simple.

The symbols whispered the same advice: sleep, guard, breathe slow.

MJ placed the lantern and pulled from her pack a small music box.

Piri had built it from spoons and sweetness.

When wound, it played a melody halfway between a lullaby and a promise.

MJ wound it and set it near the egg.

The notes slid into the stone and stayed there.

Above, a shadow passed across the courtyard.

The dragon had come back to the place where its sleep had been tangled.

MJ climbed to the ramparts and stood in the wind.

She blew the tin whistle, not the alarming note but a single high call that said, I am listening.

The dragon circled.

Its wings wrote sentences she couldn’t yet read.

“Ready,” she called.

Flags flashed from Nelli’s hill.

The net lines hummed.

Piri ladled soup as if feeding the air itself might calm it.

The dragon dove, not at them but at the memory of itself this place held.

Its claws skimmed stone.

Its eyes found MJ.

She did not flinch.

She bowed, a small gesture offered to a large truth.

“Sleep,” she said, not commanding, inviting.

She lifted the music box and let the melody unfurl into the wind.

For a heartbeat that stretched and held, the dragon’s wings slowed.

It roared, but the sound snagged on a note and softened.

“Now,” MJ whispered, and Darrin and the blacksmith pulled.

The net rose, an argument that suggested maybe landing would be wise.

The dragon hit it and the anchors sang.

The golem stepped forward, hands out, catching weight with a grunt of iron.

The fortress trembled like a heart skipping a beat.

MJ ran along the rampart, unspooling blue wool that led toward the courtyard, a path the dragon could see even through panic.

“Easy,” she called. “We are not your enemy. We are your consequence, and we are very polite.”

It thrashed.

Scales scraped stone.

The net held because belief had woven with rope.

Piri’s melody looped, sweet and stubborn.

Old Mina’s words moved through MJ’s spine: bring it down soft.

She climbed the tower until she stood level with the dragon’s eye.

Up close, the green was not anger.

It was spring trapped behind glass.

She saw fear there.

She saw hunger.

She saw a question.

MJ took off the blue wool from her wrist and tied it to the net.

“See?” she said. “Home color.”

The dragon blinked.

Its breath warmed her face—not burning, just warning.

“Sleep,” she said again, and blew the gentle whistle note.

The music box played on.

Slowly, impossibly, the dragon’s jaw lowered.

Its lids dipped.

It sagged into the net that no longer felt like a trap but like surrender to a better plan.

“Easy,” MJ said, and the golem eased weight to the ground.

When the dragon’s chest rose and fell in long, even pulls of air, the courtyard exhaled with it.

Silence returned like a friend who had stepped outside to cry and come back ready to laugh again.

They stood there, caught between terror and relief, the human balance.

“We can’t keep it,” Darrin whispered, because he had occasionally wanted a pet shop.

“No,” MJ said, smiling. “But we can lead it.”

They cut the net carefully.

They left the blue wool braided into a halter the dragon could ignore or follow.

The music box clicked softly, wound down, and waited.

“Where do we take a dragon?” Piri asked.

“Somewhere old,” MJ said. “Somewhere high. Somewhere it remembers how to be a story, not a threat.”

They led it at dusk, a procession of the improbable.

The dragon followed the blue thread and the melody in its bones.

Up the pass with the carved symbols.

Across the ridge where clouds rest their elbows.

To a charred forest that had burned long ago and learned how to green again.

There, on a crag shaped like a cradle, they left it with the music box and a meal of goats that had volunteered by being poor at fence ethics.

MJ touched its warm scales once.

“Sleep,” she said, and meant, Live.

They walked home under stars that clapped politely.

At the edge of the plain, the village ruins sighed.

In the morning, rebuilding began.

Not with speeches but with shovels.

Not with blame but with blueprints.

They raised frames where walls had sighed.

They stacked stone where fire had bragged.

They built watchtowers that were not fearful but attentive.

They carved runes into lintels that said, We remember, and also, We bake on Thursdays.

The bell was rehung, a little lower, a little wiser.

Children painted the golem’s chest where the scorch mark had turned into a badge.

Nelli cataloged stories people told about the night the sky sang flame and the day it listened back.

Piri’s bakery reopened with a sign that read, Counterclockwise Served Here.

MJ set the flower crown on the new bell tower.

She stood on the fresh-cut wall and looked to the horizon.

The hills waited, patient as always.

Curiosity sidled up, contrite and eager.

“Later,” she told it, soft and smiling.

“We have pies to deliver and a village to finish.”

But later came, as it does for those who look outward with a hand still holding home.

One evening, she climbed the tower again.

She looked toward the ridge.

A shadow circled there, not menacing, simply alive.

It banked once, as if bowing.

MJ bowed back, as if agreeing.

Behind her, laughter floated from the square where someone had told the egg joke again and the children had groaned on cue.

The bell rang once, dinner.

Twice, gratitude.

MJ descended and walked into the ordinary miracle of a table set by many hands.

Her seat was there.

Her work was there.

Her horizon was there too, waiting politely.

She would go again, of course.

That is who she was.

But now she went with a village braided into her wrist like blue wool.

Now she went knowing that some stories breathe fire, and some put it out, and the best do both until warmth is what remains.

On the new wall, she paused.

She looked over fields that had decided to be bread again.

She laughed, because joy is also a kind of defense.

“Good night,” she told the plains, the tower, the dragon, the stubborn music box, and the stars.

They answered in their different ways.

She listened.

She always had.

She always would.
