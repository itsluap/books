# Chapter 3 — The Return and the Roar

MJ ran until the map in her pocket tried to run ahead.

She ran until the hills blurred into a single thought: home.

Behind her, the air thrummed with wingbeats.

They were the sound of thunder learning choreography.

She reached the pine forest and wove between trunks, the dragon’s shadow flickering overhead like a storm deciding where to sit.

MJ blew the tin whistle Darrin had given her.

It made a sound that would have offended geese.

The dragon did not appear to be a goose.

She sprinted across the ravine using her bridge, which behaved admirably, given the circumstances.

The desert welcomed her with heat and the kind of mirages that are actually just regret.

Sand whipped her boots.

The camel from before considered joining and decided, heroically, to opt out.

By dusk, the fields came into view, golden and swaying as if practicing bravery.

MJ skidded into the square, lungs aflame with the kind of fire she could survive.

“The bell!” she gasped.

Her friends saw the look on her face and did not ask unnecessary questions.

Piri’s hand slammed the bell rope.

The sound climbed the roofs and dove into windows and wrapped around ankles and tugged.

Villagers spilled into the square with the urgency of people who knew what three rings meant.

“Threat?” asked Nelli, eyes wide and already calculating routes and rations.

MJ swallowed, nodded, and spared no pride.

“My curiosity,” she said, “woke a dragon.”

A silence ran across the square.

It tripped a few times on disbelief.

Then it stood, trembling but upright.

“We’ll evacuate to the west field,” said Old Mina, voice steady as a hand on a shoulder. “Essentials only. If it doesn’t fit in your hands, it can wait.”

“Golem with me,” called the blacksmith. “Form a line to the carts. Children in the center.”

Piri shoved bread into arms as if bread were a shield, which, in a way, it is.

Darrin grabbed a bundle of blue wool and started knotting paths like a cartographer with empathy.

MJ moved to help and then stopped.

The sky darkened.

A shadow crossed the bell tower.

The first roar arrived like a wall that did not care to stop at walls.

It shook dust from rafters.

It shook fear from hiding places.

It shook MJ until her name rattled and settled with her heart around it.

Above, the dragon circled.

It was immense in the way mountains are immense: not rude, simply undeniable.

Scales caught the last light and broke it into angry jewels.

Its eyes were old-spring green.

They were not cruel.

They were awake.

For a breath, the village forgot to move.

Then movement returned with purpose.

Arrows were fetched.

Buckets filled.

Hands found hands.

MJ looked up and felt the tug of two truths.

She had woken this.

She would not let it finish the sentence.

“Hey!” she shouted to the sky, because subtlety had left on vacation. “Over here! I am a trouble magnet in a hat!”

She waved the tin whistle and blew a note so piercing the bell flinched.

The dragon’s head tilted.

Curiosity, it turned out, was not a human-only hobby.

It dove.

MJ ran toward the fields, away from the cluster of carts, giving the creature a target of one instead of many.

Her lungs burned.

Her legs negotiated with gravity and won, barely.

She cut across a fence and into a pasture.

The dragon’s shadow washed over her like a wave.

It was close enough that the air around MJ tasted like stone struck by lightning.

She glanced back and saw its eyes again.

They still weren’t cruel.

They were intent.

At the edge of the pasture, she stumbled and went to a knee.

Her flower crown fell off, landing in a tuft of clover.

The dragon roared once more, lower this time.

It didn’t sound like victory.

It sounded like hunger and history and a warning misread.

MJ stood, heart loud.

She raised her hands.

“Okay,” she said to a being the size of an argument with the sky. “We are going to make a plan that does not involve barbecue.”

The dragon’s chest expanded.

Heat rolled over the grass.

MJ braced.

Behind her, the bell rang again—this time in a pattern: short, short, long.

Evacuation in progress.

She didn’t look back.

She didn’t need to.

The village moved like a single, determined body.

Her job was to be the distraction that did not become a statue.

She sprinted for the creek and dove, the water closing around her with a gasp of cold.

Flame rolled overhead, impatient and briefly disappointed.

She surfaced with a splutter and an indignant laugh.

“Rude,” she told the physics of combustion.

The dragon pulled up, wheeling toward the square.

MJ followed the creek, her boots clapping stones, her breath counting, her mind a compass that refused to point anywhere but home.

By the time she reached the edge of town, the market tents snapped in the updraft of wings.

People were moving, faces set, courage plain.

The golem stood at the bell tower, a statue that had agreed to dance if necessary.

The dragon’s shadow slid over cobble like a thought trying to find its words.

Its roar raked the air once more, a long, terrible note that announced, to every brick and bone, that the story had changed.

MJ met the eyes of her friends.

They did not blame.

They did not panic.

They simply did what village hearts do when skies grow teeth.

They held together.

MJ squared her shoulders.

“Round two,” she whispered, and the bell answered.
