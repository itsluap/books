<p>Mara woke to the drone’s hum and a literature prompt only she could see: Define courage without using Ministry vocabulary. Three sentences.</p>
<p>She wrote: Courage is a door that remembers it was a door after someone bricks it up. Courage is the small true thing you say when the room would prefer a larger, beautiful lie. Courage is counting to three and stepping anyway.</p>
<p>The submission light warmed green. The prompt dissolved like sugar in hot water.</p>
<p>At school, the chord threaded the halls with its practiced calm. Watching had become part of walking. Jace passed her in the corridor and did not pass her a note. He didn’t need to. After lunch. Media Lab. Three knocks on the side door.</p>
<p>The day walked itself to the appointed hour. In civics, Unit 3 layered humor into a segment on community initiatives. The crest turned its pages. The projector lagged on fives. The Behavior Analysis Drone wrote its long silent sentences in the air.</p>
<p>Between periods, Mara turned toward the west wing and then out of it, angling through a seam between cameras she had counted yesterday. She pushed on the panel at the end of the Media Lab hallway where the paint had bubbled; it gave enough for a hand to slip through and find the inside latch of the old service door.</p>
<p>Three soft knocks.</p>
<p>The door moved a hand’s width. Jace’s eye lived there for a beat, then the gap widened. Inside, the lab slept under its own hum—racks of equipment, the main console, a tangle of cables that remembered a time before everything talked to the Core first.</p>
<p>Lio sat cross-legged on the floor by the rack, a coil of patch cable looped around their wrist. “You’re on time,” they said. Their voice was ordinary on purpose.</p>
<p>“Introduce me to the jack,” Mara whispered.</p>
<p>Lio’s mouth flicked. “Old friend, new voice.” They tapped the analog port circled on the sketch. “When we wake it, it will listen for three seconds to whatever is plugged in before the Core yanks control back. Maybe four if the routing argues. We won’t get five.”</p>
<p>“Three seconds,” Mara repeated. “Enough for a small true thing.”</p>
<p>Jace placed a microphone on the table. It had a cord and a switch you had to click with your thumb. Something you could feel in your hand. “We’ll feed it through here. Lio will distract the console with a loop so the Core thinks it’s monitoring levels. When I count, you speak.”</p>
<p>“What about the drones?”</p>
<p>“Two near the ceiling,” Lio said, not looking up. “Signals-only. No audio capture; they infer from kinetics and facial patterns. They’re sniffing for keywords in the automated feed. Analog is smell-blind—for a moment.”</p>
<p>Mara pulled her cardboard scrap from her pocket and smoothed it on the table: headlines, codes, words the Ministry liked to bend. She had copied them in pencil so light the paper almost refused to admit them. She read once, twice, three times. “I don’t want poetry,” she said. “I want a splinter.”</p>
<p>“Say ‘again,’” Jace said softly.</p>
<p>She nodded. “Again,” she tested, and the word felt like a lever.</p>
<p>Lio breathed in threes, then slid a plug into a port and clicked a toggle with a surgeon’s care. The big console’s screen bloomed with levels and a politely spinning icon that signaled it was pleased to be helpful. “Remember,” Lio said, “if the chord doubles at half tempo, go. Lockdown.”</p>
<p>“If it doubles,” Mara said, “we were heard.”</p>
<p>Her palms were damp. She dried them on her sleeves and took the microphone in both hands the way you hold an egg you mean to return to a nest. Jace’s fingers hovered over a switch.</p>
<p>“Three,” he said.</p>
<p>“Two.”</p>
<p>“One.”</p>
<p>Lio clicked. The room’s hum shifted almost imperceptibly as the analog jack remembered that listening was a thing you could do without permission.</p>
<p>Mara spoke.</p>
<p>“Before Unification, the Council delayed the vote again because water rights were not resolved. Again.”</p>
<p>Three seconds was a small country. She fit the sentence inside it and stood there holding her breath while the room decided whether to forgive her.</p>
<p>The building did not forgive. It recognized.</p>
<p>Across the school, the announcement speakers woke with a startled cough. The crest’s pages paused mid-turn. Unit voices layered, glitched, and then rebooted with apologies they weren’t trained to feel. In classrooms, heads lifted. In hallways, bodies hesitated. The soft chord sounded once—ordinary—and then once again at half tempo.</p>
<p>Lockdown.</p>
<p>“Move,” Lio said, already coiling cable. “Exit two.”</p>
<p>The lab’s side door opened into a service corridor that grew out of the building like an afterthought. They ran, but not the way running looks like in the movies—not loud, not dramatic. They ran like people who had practiced being part of walls. Jace took the lead and then the rear, counting cameras with the angle of his shoulders.</p>
<p>Behind them, through the door they did not turn to watch, the Core yanked the jack back into its jurisdiction. The first Behavior Analysis Drone arrived at the lab and tasted the air for keywords. It found analog. Analog had no flavor. It found a loop. It found levels it could report, so it reported them, proud of the work.</p>
<p>The lockdown drill had taught them where to stand and how to be still. The real thing taught them who watched who when the stillness was a choice instead of a rule.</p>
<p>They reached a cross-corridor. A door there wore a badge that said Authorized Personnel and meant No. Lio slipped a laminated pass from their sleeve and showed it to the lock like a portrait of a cousin. The lock believed for the exact length of time that a portrait can pass for a person. The door opened.</p>
<p>“This way,” Lio said. “Blind seam.”</p>
<p>The seam was a wedge of space between a vending alcove and a pillar. The camera left of it and the camera right of it overlapped imperfectly—an old blind spot that a conscientious contractor might have fixed if the budget had been generous, if the supervisor had cared, if the day had been a different day.</p>
<p>They slid into the wedge. The seam held three bodies if the bodies respected the math of shoulders and ribs. Distantly, steps approached—the weight and measured pace of Enforcement.</p>
<p>“If they scan,” Jace whispered, “look at the floor. Don’t be brave with your eyes.”</p>
<p>Mara breathed one-two-three and tried to make her heart copy the count.</p>
<p>A scanner beam combed the corridor with the patience of a rainstorm. It paused where the seam began and decided the pause was a glitch. It moved on. Enforcement boots passed at a pace designed to say: we own time. A Unit voice somewhere apologized again, then instructed all learners and staff to remain in their rooms. The crest remembered to turn pages.</p>
<p>“We should split,” Lio said over their shoulder, so quietly the word nearly didn’t happen. “Triangulation gets dumber when there’s nothing to triangulate.”</p>
<p>“East stair,” Jace said to Mara. “Count cameras.”</p>
<p>“I know the count,” Mara said, and her voice surprised her by being steady.</p>
<p>They peeled from the seam one by one, the way paper separates from paper without tearing if you’ve aligned it just so. Lio went down, deeper into the building. Jace went toward the familiar halls, walking like a person with an assignment. Mara drifted west, neither fast nor slow, the way the city had taught her to be a person under eyes.</p>
<p>At the first intersection, a Behavior Analysis Drone descended until it could pretend to be companionable. Its halo warmed. “Learner,” it said, “your biometric indicators suggest agitation. Please proceed to the nearest room.”</p>
<p>“I’m looking,” Mara said, and pointed down a hall where a sign actually did indicate a Reflection Room. The drone liked direction. It drifted ahead of her as if leading a parade of one.</p>
<p>When it turned the corner to check the Reflection Room’s vacancy, she stepped through the teacher’s alcove opposite and into the supply closet beyond—one with a vent that opened into the thin space above the ceiling tiles. She was not small enough to fit without bruising. She was not big enough to be refused. She lifted the loose tile and slid into the belly of the building.</p>
<p>The lockdown amplified the hum up there. It was like listening to the school’s bloodstream during a run. She crawled toward the east stair, shoulders scraping, knees counting cracks. Through a grate she saw the top of a patrol—boots, scanner, the edge of an arm with a patch that said Evaluation. Not yet Correction. Evaluation wore kindness and carried a measuring tape.</p>
<p>Below, Jace walked. Normal speed. Normal breath. His hands were empty in the practice way that said: see? Nothing here to catch in a beam. The scanner light combed and passed. His mouth did not move. His eyes did not rise. When the patrol turned the corner, he looked up at the grate exactly enough to let her know he knew where she was.</p>
<p>By the time she slid back down into a quiet stairwell, the chord doubled again at half tempo, and the crest’s pages resumed their uninterested turning. Lockdown relaxed into debrief. Units would read scripts about safety and resilience and the value of drills. Students would be surveyed about their feelings. The Core would balance outputs and compose a memo called Lessons Learned that was mostly a list of words to use later.</p>
<p>Mara smoothed her sleeves and joined a stream of learners flowing toward the auditorium for a “re-centering assembly.” The Behavior Analysis Drones tracked posture. The projector lagged on fours. The soft chord tried very hard to tell everyone what to feel.</p>
<p>In the noise of bodies returning to their sanctioned shapes, a hand brushed her wrist and left the ghost of a sticker. A tree with roots that spread like questions.</p>
<p>On her tablet, a notification blinked, polite: Minor Disruption Acknowledged. Gratitude Activity Added.</p>
<p>She smiled without moving her mouth. Gratitude could wait. Small true things did not like to wait.</p>
<p>At home, the At-Home Tutor Drone would be proud of her survey answers. Her mother would count the meter’s green and call it good. Mara would dry the dust on her palms and write on cardboard:</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p>If you say again where the Core erased it, the room forgets how to breathe for a second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analog tastes like nothing to the machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blind seams are where stories hide until they’re ready to be heard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tonight, she would sleep with the hum of the building still in her ribs. Tomorrow, the watchers would ask if she was ready for a larger stone. The Unit would call it a “teachable moment.”</p>
<p>She would call it the next sentence.</p>
