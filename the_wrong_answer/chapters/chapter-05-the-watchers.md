# Chapter 5 — The Watchers

By morning the school had remembered how to smile. Screens glowed with the Ministry crest, pages turning themselves at the exact interval, the soft chord moving through the building like breath. The citrus in the vents had been tuned up a degree, the way a host sprays a room before guests arrive.

Mara walked the corridor feeling the room count her. Cameras did not stare, but they did not blink either. A Behavior Analysis Drone drifted at ceiling height, halo dim as a polite moon. It lingered longer than usual at intersections, learning how students braided around each other, learning what agitation looked like in the wild.

In literature, Unit 2 asked what courage was. The class offered the required answers—service, sacrifice, alignment with the common good. Mara measured the lag on the projector: fours, this room. She kept her face soft. She did not say that sometimes courage was a bent hairpin and a door that remembered you.

At her elbow, a note appeared without texture or ceremony. A corner of paper, folded twice, then once again. She did not see a hand leave it. She did not look down until the Unit turned to annotate a sentence on the wall.

The note was blank on the side facing up. She slid it under her sleeve. Later, in the hallway between classes, she pressed it to the inside of her wrist and let the edge tell her the words through skin: three dots, a short line, the number 3. Stairwell, level three.

She moved with the bodies toward math and then, at the turn, did not turn. No one saw her not turn. Seeing was dangerous even when your eyes were open.

The stairwell on level three had learned to be forgotten. The light over the landing flickered at a patient interval. A sign warned of “Under-Construction Access,” which meant money had once been allocated to fix something and then decided to be useful somewhere else. The camera at the top was misaligned by a degree that could be mistaken for accident. Mara stood under it and let the building hum tell her the difference between alone and watched.

“You came,” Jace said.

He stepped out from the shadowed turn of the steps, hands empty, palms visible. The gesture was ritual more than necessity. It said: I brought nothing that will betray us except what is living.

“You sent a note,” she said.

He didn’t ask how she knew it was him. He looked at her cuffs. Dust still lived there, soft as old breath. “You found the wing,” he said.

Mara lifted one shoulder. “I found a room that remembered how to be a room.”

He smiled without showing teeth. “You shouldn’t go alone.” A beat. “Or you shouldn’t keep going alone.”

“I wasn’t planning to.” She hadn’t planned any of this. Planning implied a clean line from now to later. She had only ever had patterns and cracks and the numbers that told the truth.

Jace leaned against the wall where the paint bubbled like old ice. “There are people who notice what you notice. They call us anomalies. We call ourselves watchers.” He let the word sit, not to impress her, but to see what it did in the air.

“Watchers,” she repeated. The Behavior Analysis Drone far down the corridor drifted past the stairwell mouth and did not look in. The word watcher used to mean a machine. It had room, apparently, to mean a person again.

“We don’t break things,” Jace said. “We make systems argue with themselves. Little contradictions, careful ones. You’ve already felt it.”

Mara thought of Unit 9’s smile freezing, the crest’s pages mid-turn, the banner on her screen that wouldn’t let itself finish the word contradiction. “Yes.”

“We need writers,” he said. “People who can plant small true things with the right cadence so the Core upgrades them from noise to signal.”

“How many are you?”

He looked at the stair where a scuff mark had become a constellation. “Enough to ask the question without anyone counting the hands.” He met her eyes. “Not enough to stop what happens if they decide you’re a risk.”

“The Correction Center,” she said, and the air around the word cooled.

Jace’s face did not change, which meant he had practiced not changing it. “You’ll hear official words. Evaluation. Stabilization. Resilience reinforcement. The corridor there smells like lavender cut with metal. They play the chord slower, and they call it calming.” He swallowed. “They ask you to tell them a story about yourself until the edges of the story blur. Then they help you round the edges off.”

He didn’t say what he had seen. He didn’t have to. The sentence had more words that would have changed the room if spoken.

“How do you know?” Mara asked, softly.

"I delivered something once," he said. "A package. I didn’t look in it." He smiled without humor. "I learned to look at the air around things instead." He flexed the fingers of his left hand; the top knuckle was crooked from a door that hadn’t wanted to open. "Sometimes the cost is a joint you carry with you."

They let silence do work while a class changed above them. Feet moved like rain. The light over the landing flickered its patient flicker.

“What do you want from me?” Mara asked.

"Nothing," Jace said, too quickly. He corrected it. “Nothing you don’t already have.” He uncurled his fingers. In his palm lay a roots sticker, the kind children earned for answering correctly. It was not the crest. It was a tree with roots that spread like questions. Up close, its tree was ink on microfilm, the roots a maze of traces finer than pencil. The microfilm wasn’t decoration; warmed and wired, it could be taught to listen—briefly—and it preferred to tell no one but paper. “If you want to find us, put this on the inside of your locker door and then take it off before end-of-day. If you don’t, throw it away and tell yourself it was a joke.”

“Roots,” she said.

“Old library stamp,” he said. “Most of us found the wing one way or another. Some of us found each other before we found the wing. The sticker’s the same symbol—sometimes just a sign, sometimes a tool.”

“How do you meet without the drones counting bodies?”

“We don’t meet,” he said. “We overlap.” He gestured with his chin toward the wall. “There are blind seams between the cameras, places where the Core estimates instead of seeing. We write on paper. We pass it by hand. Paper leaves smaller wakes than messages. We say the wrong words on purpose in rooms that lag on threes.” He tilted his head, listening to the building. “You hear the threes.”

“I do.”

“Then say one thing you can’t type.”

Mara looked at his empty hands and at her own, which were not empty but had learned to seem so. She thought of the binder labeled Alignment Narrative—Public Facing Guidelines. She thought of the local paper’s headline: vote delayed again. She thought of the envelope stuck under the periodicals rack with a name that was hers but might not have been.

“Again,” she said. “The word ‘again’ exists. It existed then. They removed it.”

Jace inhaled, a small wonder. “Good,” he said. “Here’s mine.” He leaned closer, not for a dramatic whisper but because the stairwell had decided whispers were honest here. “The announcement system still has an analog jack in the Media Lab. It’s dead unless someone tells it to listen. We have a person who can make it listen. When it listens, it forgets to ask permission.”

“And you’ll need a person who can make it say something worth hearing,” Mara said.

His mouth made the shape of yes without letting the sound out. “Not yet,” he added. “First, we teach the Core doubt. There’s a pattern to how it weighs sources. We’ve been throwing pebbles at it. We need stones.” He looked at her in the way people look at bridges to see if they’ll hold. “You can quarry.”

“I can write,” she said. “And I can listen.”

“Listening is half the quarry,” he said.

He raised his hand as if to touch her sleeve and then didn’t. “There’ll be a test.”

She almost laughed. “There always is.”

“Not that kind.” His eyes flicked to the stairwell mouth. The Behavior Analysis Drone had returned, halo brighter now, learning the edges of after-school. “After last bell, the west courtyard. Sit on the fourth bench and tie your shoe. If someone says, ‘Do you know where the roots are deeper?’ say, ‘Under old brick.’ If no one comes, go home.”

“Under old brick,” she repeated.

“Careful,” he said. “Not quiet.”

“I remember.”

They peeled apart and re-entered the stream. The day finished its disciplined march. In science, the projector in that room still didn’t lag at all. In civics, Unit 3’s humor cues landed on fives. The crest turned its pages. The chord braided through hours.

After last bell, the courtyard behaved like a brochure about childhood. Students clustered in sanctioned ways. Clubs reorganized themselves around bright posters. Drones hovered low enough to be almost companionable. The fourth bench was made of slats that snagged on tights; someone had carved initials there with a key. M+K, then crossed out. Consensus revised.

Mara sat and tied her shoe, which did not need tying. She did it slowly, three loops of the lace around her finger as if she were practicing a magic trick.

“Do you know where the roots are deeper?” a voice asked, the way a person might ask about weather they already knew the report for.

She did not look up immediately. Looking up too quickly read as guilt in systems that recorded kinetics. “Under old brick,” she said, and let her voice choose calm.

The owner of the voice was a younger student with a face that had learned how not to be a face in photos. Their hair was cut blunt, their backpack nondescript. They sat without touching the bench, as if the bench had not yet given permission. “You’re Mara,” they said, not a question.

“Sometimes,” Mara said.

“I’m Lio,” they said. “Sometimes.” Their mouth twitched the way mouths do when they collect smiles to spend them wisely. “We watch. You write. That’s the rumor.”

“Rumors are helpful when they’re pointed at the right truth,” Mara said.

Lio nodded at the brick wall along the courtyard’s edge. “There used to be a door there,” they said. “Before they filled it with brick. The map still thinks it opens sometimes.” They handed her a folded paper the size of a playing card. “Don’t open it in the building.”

“I won’t,” Mara said.

“Tonight,” Lio said, “if you hear the chord twice in a row at half tempo, don’t look at the window. Count to three. Then look at the floor.”

“A signal,” Mara said.

“A test,” Lio corrected, and their eyes warmed. “If you pass, there’ll be an essay prompt for the morning no one else will see.”

They rose in one clean movement and blended into a knot of students who were loudly being ordinary. The drone above the courtyard tracked laughter and found it acceptable.

Mara went home with the paper burning against her palm like a small sun. She did not open it on the transit pod. She did not open it on the stairs. In the apartment, the At-Home Tutor Drone welcomed her with the usual, the meter glowed its decent green, and her mother stirred soup in threes.

In her room, with the drone pretending to sleep, she slid a fingernail under the fold and lifted. Inside, the paper carried a sketch of the Media Lab’s equipment rack, drawn from memory or from a plan. An analog jack was circled in pencil. Next to it, in a hand not unlike her own, three words: teach it doubt.

She tucked the drawing into the seam under the table with her Small True Things and wrote a new line on the cardboard:

10) Roots grow where the brick forgets it was a door.

She lay back and let the apartment’s two kinds of quiet layer over each other. When the chord came, once and then once again at half tempo, her throat tightened. She counted: one, two, three. Then she looked at the floor. Nothing happened except that she had done what a stranger asked, and it had felt like a word you say back in a language you are still learning.

In the morning, the literature prompt on her tablet read, for her and no one else: Define courage without using Ministry vocabulary. Three sentences.

She smiled into the room that pretended not to watch and began to write.
