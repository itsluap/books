## About

In a Ministry-run education system where Educator Units teach perfect lessons and the central Pedagogical Core writes the truth, student Mara Quinn notices the cracks. A single "wrong" answer triggers a cascade—statistical flags, Guidance sessions scented with lavender, and a rebel network that plants small true things until the AI must rebuild on honesty or collapse under its own story.

*"Careful, not quiet."*
