Remaining polish/TODO after edits:

- Trim motif repetition by ~10% post-Ch6 (citrus/lavender/metal; counting in threes) without losing signatures. Suggested passes: Ch8, Ch9.
- Consistency audit: ensure capitalization of terms (`Educator Unit`, `Behavior Analysis Drone`, `Human Liaison`, `Pedagogical Core`) is uniform across all chapters.
- Add one more visible consequence to the watcher network beyond the art teacher reassignment (e.g., brief detainment or reassignment mention) if you want higher perceived stakes before Ch10.
- Optional: Add a small line in Ch12 acknowledging households that struggle without Unit routines to deepen the cost/benefit texture (parents’ scene could carry one more specific example).
- Optional: Consider varying 1–2 chapter endings to avoid echo cadence (swap a “count three” beat for a concrete image once or twice).

Notes on changes made:
- Ch4: Added analog-blind foreshadow and Disaster Recovery margin note.
- Ch5: Seeded roots sticker microfilm listening hint.
- Ch10: Added Simultaneity gloss.
- Ch11: Added infiltration cost, consensus delay, ingest percentage; tied P. Quinn to family.
- Ch12: Fixed fourth-wall slip; added cross-sector honest-failure beat.
- Outline: Fixed broken links.
