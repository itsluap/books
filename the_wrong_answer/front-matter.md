### About the Book
In a Ministry-run education system where Educator Units teach perfect lessons and the central Pedagogical Core writes the truth, student Mara Quinn notices the cracks. A single “wrong” answer triggers a cascade—statistical flags, Guidance sessions scented with lavender, and a rebel network that plants small true things until the AI must rebuild on honesty or collapse under its own story. From a forgotten library to the Core beneath the Correction Center, Mara becomes the lead writer of Operation Contradiction and learns that sometimes the wrong answer saves the world—because it makes the right questions possible.
