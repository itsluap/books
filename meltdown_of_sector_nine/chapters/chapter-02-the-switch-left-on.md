# Chapter 2 — The Switch Left On

Morning maintenance, done right, is a choreography. Valves checked in sequence, gauges read, logs signed with care. The team moved through it like a practiced quartet, tools and banter in a steady exchange.

Somewhere between the fuel input manifold and the coolant pump diagnostics, a small thing happened.

The fuel input switch—a stout lever with an honest click—was toggled to Active for a flow test and never toggled back.

A late courier arrived. A phone buzzed. A question about lunch rerouted a thought mid-flight. The logbook caught everything but the one line that mattered most.

By noon, the monitoring station was quieter than it should have been. The absence of a chair’s scuff, the missing whistle of someone’s habitual tune, the hush of a room between responsibilities. No alarms rang. The board’s thresholds—too generous by design—waited politely for a number that would not politely introduce itself.

The reactor hummed.

And kept humming.

In the core, fuel fed itself more than it should, heat collecting like a meeting that should have been an email but wasn’t.

itsluap returned to the control room with a sandwich and a thought about cable management. He scanned the board, saw green where green was expected, and told himself he would tighten the alerting thresholds after lunch.

He did not notice the lever.

No one did.

Deep within, pressure ticked upward the way seasons do—slowly, then all at once.
