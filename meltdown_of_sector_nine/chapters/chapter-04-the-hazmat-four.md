# Chapter 4 — The Hazmat Four

They met at the cordon where the world still had color.

itsluap, noma, dannyyodog, and callsign checked each other’s seals with the tenderness of surgeons and the speed of firefighters. Suits hissed as they pressurized. Visors fogged and cleared. Their names, taped in block letters over the chest, made the whole thing feel like camp and war at once.

“Okay,” callsign said, voice tinny in the radio. “We do this slow. We do this right.”

The dead zone accepted them without ceremony. Geiger counters chattered in their pockets like anxious sparrows. Shovels bit into soil that felt heavier than soil should.

They moved in a rhythm: scrape, bag, seal, stack. Replace and seal again. Leak search, patch, log. Every action had a checklist; every checklist had a partner.

They found a weeping joint and collar-clamped it until it behaved. They sealed a culvert that had been insisting on being a river. They hauled out blocks so hot the tongs vibrated with the idea of them.

Breaks were short and quiet. Humor survived in rationed sips.

“What’s worse,” dannyyodog asked at one point, “the smell of these suits or the smell outside?”

“The suits,” noma said. “Outside is the absence of smell and that is worse.”

“And yet,” callsign added, “here we are, perfumed like plastic fear.”

At dusk, they stood on a ridge of scraped earth and looked back at their day’s work: a geometry of caution, a map of careful decisions.

“It’s not enough,” itsluap said, because truth is a tool too.

“It’s a start,” noma answered, and they walked the perimeter again.
