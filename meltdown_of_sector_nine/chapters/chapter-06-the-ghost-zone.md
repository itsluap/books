# Chapter 6 — The Ghost Zone

The new reactor lived on the horizon like a well-behaved star. It sent power along lines that no longer sagged, and it sent quiet along nerves that no longer frayed.

Sector Nine, the old one, slept under signs and sky.

Wild mobs skirted the fences. Foxes learned new paths. The grass at the border grew in a way that suggested caution even to the wind.

itsluap, noma, dannyyodog, and callsign visited sometimes, together or alone. They walked the perimeter and did not cross it. They checked the badges they no longer needed to wear and told the silence what they had learned.

“It was one lever,” callsign said once, not arguing, just naming. “And a thousand decisions around it.”

They built a small bench where the ridge looked down on the sealed dome. People came and sat with their thoughts and left with new ones.

The ghost zone did not stop being a wound. It became a scar that knew its own story.

On a clear day, the four of them stood there and watched a cloud pass slowly over the old site, shading it like a hand over a child’s eyes.

“We did not fix it,” noma said.

“We did the next right things,” itsluap answered.

They nodded, a habit now, and turned toward the hum that powered the kingdom.
