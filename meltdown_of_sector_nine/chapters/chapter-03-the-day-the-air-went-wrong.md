# Chapter 3 — The Day the Air Went Wrong

It began as a tremor felt more in memory than underfoot—a wrongness that prickled skin before it rattled glass.

A dull thud rolled through Sector Nine, as if the earth had swallowed a cough. Then came the breach.

Invisible, the first wave passed like a ghost with a mean streak. Grass bent and did not stand back up. Leaves sagged into a color with no name. Birds lifted, panicked, then veered as if drunk on nothing.

itsluap reached the ridge in time to see heat shiver the horizon. The reactor dome, so sure of itself, wore a bright wound it had never planned to show.

“Mask,” noma said, already pulling his on. They had rehearsed this. They had hoped not to.

Radiation is a quiet thief. It steals certainty first. The monitoring badges ticked up like reluctant metronomes. The air—indistinguishable and suddenly enemy—threaded sickness into anyone who stepped inside without armor.

Within an hour, the sector went still. Animals fled to the edges and swayed there, confused. Wind skimmed the ground like it was afraid to commit. The color leached from things that had loved their own colors.

itsluap tasted metal and regret. “We shut it down, we contain, we clean,” he said, because sentences can be scaffolds when everything else falls.

And then he called for help.
