# Chapter 1 — Pride of the Kingdom

The scaffolds were gone, the last welds cooled to a noble gray, and the control room smelled faintly of ozone and new beginnings.

itsluap and noma stood shoulder to shoulder beneath the status board, a wall of soft lights that blinked like patient stars. The reactor core, wrapped in reinforced lattice and humming a contented note, sat at the heart of Sector Nine—part monument, part promise.

“This is it,” noma said. “No more brownouts for the northern farms. No more night shifts for the smelters unless they want them.”

itsluap’s grin was equal parts pride and relief. “Automated scrams, redundant coolant, pressure relief that could calm a thunderhead.” He patted the console like it had a heartbeat. “We did it right.”

The unveiling drew the kingdom close. Builders traced the elegant pipework with appreciative eyes. Redstone engineers whispered over relay paths. The council signed the final permit with ceremonial ink.

A lever was thrown. The core came alive.

Power streamed out in careful rivers, feeding rails and lanterns, mills and mines. The lights of the sector evened to a warm, honest glow—the kind of illumination that said you could read by it without worry and walk home without fear.

itsluap took a breath that tasted like victory and coolant.

“Flawless,” noma said, and for a while, it truly was.

The reactor learned the rhythm of the grid. The grid learned the patience of capacity. People adapted to the steady heartbeat of energy—a bass note under daily life that promised continuity.

On opening night, they hosted a small celebration in the turbine hall. Cupcakes balanced on clipboards. Laughter clinked against steel. Someone tuned a guitar; someone else tuned a monitoring algorithm.

itsluap raised a cup. “To work that holds, and systems that forgive.”

They drank to that, not knowing how dear those words would become.
