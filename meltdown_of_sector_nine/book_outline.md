The Meltdown of Sector Nine - 6 Chapter Outline

Chapter 1 - Pride of the Kingdom
itsluap and noma unveil the largest and most advanced nuclear reactor the server has ever seen.
The build is flawless: reinforced walls, automated systems, and unmatched efficiency.
The project is celebrated as the dawn of a new era for the kingdom.
No one suspects that a single oversight could undo it all.

Chapter 2 - The Switch Left On
During a routine maintenance check, the fuel input switch is accidentally left active.
The reactor hums quietly, consuming more and more fuel, running far beyond safe limits.
No one notices — the monitoring station is empty, the alarms unheard.
Deep within the reactor core, heat and pressure begin to spiral out of control.

Chapter 3 - The Day the Air Went Wrong
Without warning, the reactor breaches.
A blast of invisible radiation spreads outward, silently poisoning the land.
Grass withers into brittle ash; animals flee but stumble as if dazed.
Those who enter without protection feel an immediate, bone-deep sickness.
The once-thriving Sector Nine becomes a shimmering wasteland.

Chapter 4 - The Hazmat Four
itsluap calls in dannyyodog and callsign to join himself and noma in emergency containment.
All four don bright hazmat suits and step into the dead zone.
The cleanup is grueling — shoveling irradiated soil, sealing leaking pipes, disposing of contaminated blocks.
Despite their efforts, the land remains scarred; it feels as though nature itself has abandoned hope.

Chapter 5 - Relocation and Resolve
The council of the kingdom gathers to decide the future.
A unanimous decision is made: rebuild the reactor far away from any settlement.
This time, every safety precaution is doubled — fail-safes, auto-shutdowns, and constant monitoring.
Though the work begins, the shadow of the meltdown lingers over every conversation.

Chapter 6 - The Ghost Zone
The new reactor hums safely in the distance, powering the kingdom without incident.
But the old site remains sealed — a silent monument to the cost of one mistake.
Wild mobs avoid it; those who wander too close never behave the same again.
itsluap, noma, dannyyodog, and callsign rarely speak of those days… but when they do, their voices drop, and their eyes drift toward the horizon where Sector Nine still sleeps.
